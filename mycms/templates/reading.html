      Mexico's Growth Problem

    Mexico has experienced a mediocre growth rate in comparison to its peer countries in the region, despite the fact that its largest companies have grown significantly.

    <div class="outlineTitle">
    What's the Cause?
    </div>
    <div class="outlineRest">
    The absence of entrepreneurship and the slow growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which increase "the size of the pie," rather than just take a bigger share of the existing one.

	The Public Policy Solution
      </div>
      <div class="outlineRest">If the goal of national policymakers in Mexico is to increase the country's GDP, the most efficient course of action is to help SMEs grow into large companies, as opposed to encouraging microenterprise.

	  Many Rules, Uneven Enforcement
